== Welcome to ZWB

The ZWB rails app displays if a stock is a buy using algorithms taken from the book "The Warren Buffet Way". The algorithms are applied to a very specific set of stocks that have ROE of 15% or better. A user cannot delete or change the data, or stocks of the initial stock set. The algorithms use 10 years of historical data, such as EPS, and all data needed is found in the Value Line investment survey.

The output of the ZWB app will display a table of data with the results of the calculations for all the stocks in the list and will indicate if a specific stock is a "buy". The ZWB app will have the ability for a user to login. Users will be able to add an additional stock and data to the list as a way to compare a new stock against the initial set used in this case as a benchmark. ZWB will provide a way to track a portfolio of stocks as well, and a user will have the ability to have multiple portfolios.

Optional features of ZWB would be to create a chart to show the proportions of a users holdings.
